###Task manager
I'm a person who passionate about my own productivity. I want to manage my tasks and projects more effectively. I need a simple tool that supports me in controlling my task-flow

**Functional requirements**<br>
★ I want to be able to create/update/delete projects<br>
★ I want to be able to add tasks to my project<br>
★ I want to be able to update/delete tasks<br>
★ I want to be able to prioritize tasks into a project<br>
★ I want to be able to choose deadline for my task<br>
★ I want to be able to mark a task as 'done'<br>

**Technical requirements**<br>
★ It should be a WEB application<br>
★ For the client side must be used: HTML, CSS (any libs as Twitter Bootstrap, Blueprint ...), JavaScript (any libs as jQuery, Prototype ...)<br>
★ For a server side any language as Ruby, PHP, Python, JavaScript, C#, Java ...<br>
★ It should have a client side and server side validation<br>
★ It should look like on screens (see attached file 'test_task_view.png').<br>

**Additional functionality**<br>
★ It should work like one page WEB application and should use AJAX technology, load and submit data without reloading a page.<br>
★ It should have user authentication solution and a user should only have access to their own projects and tasks. <br>
★ It should have automated tests for the all functionality. <br>

Enjoy! :wink:
